        <h3>Hi, I'm Jen!</h3>
<p>I’m a highly collaborative visual designer, art director, multitasker extraordinaire, and a pretty badass weekend warrior mountain biker.</p>
<p>I’m creative and detail-oriented — a passionate leader and team player with a proven track record for translating complex ideas into sleek, successful solutions. I’ve managed and motivated interdisciplinary teams, both as the official in-house go-to gal and agency powerhouse. I’ve helped build and manage brands, worn many hats, and jumped through hoops to find the solution for every client and create remarkable customer experiences.</p>
<p>I am currently working as the Lead Senior Experiential Graphic Designer at The Franklin Institute.</p>
<p>My key areas of experience include Art Direction and Senior-Level Design. I have expertise in print and digital formats for experiential and environmental design, branding, brand management, project and team management, and design direction. I have also been known to put together a mean excel spreadsheet every once in a while, and I can ride a bike pretty well. If I’m not sure how to do something, I’ll find a way to make it happen.</p>
<p>It sounds cheesy, but I love what I do every day and love working with clients who are as passionate about their business as I am about design. I design because I love doing it. I thrive on building lasting relationships while producing quality work for aspiring, open-minded clients who understand and value the creative journey and process.</p>

NOW/NEXT is built for speed, features-changing exhibits fueled by pop culture and emerging trends in science and technology. Designed with modular components are used to maintain a responsive, flexible space that invites visitors into the dynamic pace of innovation. The hardware, cabling, and infrastructure of the exhibit are exposed, serving as the backdrop for objects, large projections, colorful diagrams, graphics, and animations. (Funded by The Barra Foundation)

For this project I art directed and designed Now/Next, working with a team to conceptualize the content strategy. From there, I developed the design strategy and produced all exhibit graphics, as well as marketing and brand materials. In order to make engaging, and easy-to-understand interpretative interactives and videos, I worked with local animators ([ReMade](http://weareremade.com/)) to build animated features." class="jf-work-img" />
