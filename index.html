        <h3>Hi, I'm Jen!</h3>
<p>I’m a highly collaborative graphic designer, art director, multitasker extraordinaire, and a pretty badass weekend warrior mountain biker.</p>
<p>I’m creative and detail-oriented — a passionate leader and team player with a proven track record for translating complex ideas into sleek, successful solutions. I’ve managed and motivated interdisciplinary teams, both as the official in-house go-to gal and agency powerhouse. I’ve helped build and manage brands, worn many hats, and jumped through hoops to find the solution for every client and create remarkable customer experiences.</p>
<p>I am currently working as the Lead Senior Experiential Graphic Designer at The Franklin Institute.</p>
<p>My key areas of experience include Art Direction and Senior-Level Design. I have expertise in print and digital formats for experiential and environmental design, branding, brand management, project and team management, and design direction. I have also been known to put together a mean excel spreadsheet every once in a while, and I can ride a bike pretty well. If I’m not sure how to do something, I’ll find a way to make it happen.</p>
<p>It sounds cheesy, but I love what I do every day and love working with clients who are as passionate about their business as I am about design. I design because I love doing it. I thrive on building lasting relationships while producing quality work for aspiring, open-minded clients who understand and value the creative journey and process.</p>
