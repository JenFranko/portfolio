                <p>The Field Trip Planner is mailed to elementary through high school education administrators and teachers to help promote the Franklin Institute’s field trip resources. In 2017, we paired down the piece to be a promotional poster for teachers to hang in the classroom focusing on careers in science and keep the museum front of mind. On the flip side, we highlighted our permanent exhibits, workshop offerings, planetarium, educational Imax shows, and new exhibitions opening that year. The challenge for this design was to create a visual brand that appealed to teachers to book a field trip, but would also appeal to students once hung in the classroom. Of course, all of this also had to stay true to the Franklin Institute’s visual identity and mission.</p>
