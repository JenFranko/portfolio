        <h4>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h4>
<p>NOW/NEXT is built for speed, features changing exhibits fueled by pop culture and emerging trends in science and technology. Designed with modular components are used to maintain a responsive, flexible space that invites visitors into the dynamic pace of innovation. The hardware, cabling, and infrastructure of the exhibit are exposed, serving as the backdrop for objects, large projections, colorful diagrams, graphics, and animations. (Funded by The Barra Foundation)</p>
<p>For this project I art directed and designed Now/Next, working with a team to conceptualize the content strategy. From there, I developed the design strategy and produced all exhibit graphics, as well as marketing and brand materials. In order to make engaging, and easy-to-understand interpretative interactives and videos, I worked with local animators (ReMade) to build animated features.</p>
