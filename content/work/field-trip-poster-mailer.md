  The Field Trip Planner is mailed to elementary through high school education
  administrators and teachers to help promote the Franklin Institute’s field
  trip resources. In 2017, we paired down the piece to be a promotional poster
  for teachers to hang in the classroom focusing on careers in science and keep
  the museum front of mind. On the flip side, we highlighted our permanent
  exhibits, workshop offerings, planetarium, educational Imax shows, and new
  exhibitions opening that year. The challenge for this design was to create a
  visual brand that appealed to teachers to book a field trip, but would also
  appeal to students once hung in the classroom. Of course, all of this also had
  to stay true to the Franklin Institute’s visual identity and mission.
