      ### Hi, I'm Jen!


      I’m a highly collaborative art director, visual designer, multitasker
      extraordinaire, and a pretty badass weekend warrior mountain biker.


      I’m creative and detail-oriented — a passionate leader and team player
      with a proven track record for translating complex ideas into sleek,
      successful solutions. I’ve managed and motivated interdisciplinary teams,
      both as the official in-house go-to gal and agency powerhouse. I’ve helped
      build and manage brands, worn many hats, and jumped through hoops to find
      the solution for every client and create remarkable customer experiences.


      During my work experience, I’ve built my expertise art directing print and
      digital campaigns across experiential and environmental design, branding,
      and brand management while leading and mentoring design teams working in
      agency and corporate positions. I have also been known to put together a
      mean excel spreadsheet every once in a while and recharge with some coffee
      and a jigsaw puzzle on the weekend. If I’m not sure how to do something,
      I’ll find a way to make it happen.


      It sounds cheesy, but I love what I do every day and love working with
      people who are as passionate about their business as I am about design. I
      design because I love doing it. I thrive on building and fostering lasting
      relationships while producing quality work for aspiring, open-minded
      people who understand and value the creative journey and process to
      further business-driven goals.
