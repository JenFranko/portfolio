      ### Hi, I'm Jen!


      I’m a highly collaborative visual designer, art director, multitasker
      extraordinaire, and a pretty badass weekend warrior mountain biker.


      I’m creative and detail-oriented — a passionate leader and team player
      with a proven track record for translating complex ideas into sleek,
      successful solutions. I’ve managed and motivated interdisciplinary teams,
      both as the official in-house go-to gal and agency powerhouse. I’ve helped
      build and manage brands, worn many hats, and jumped through hoops to find
      the solution for every client and create remarkable customer experiences.


      I am currently working as the Lead Senior Experiential Graphic Designer at
      The Franklin Institute.


      My key areas of experience include Art Direction and Senior-Level Design.
      I have expertise in print and digital formats for experiential and
      environmental design, branding, brand management, project and team
      management, and design direction. I have also been known to put together a
      mean excel spreadsheet every once in a while, and I can ride a bike pretty
      well. If I’m not sure how to do something, I’ll find a way to make it
      happen.


      It sounds cheesy, but I love what I do every day and love working with
      clients who are as passionate about their business as I am about design. I
      design because I love doing it. I thrive on building lasting relationships
      while producing quality work for aspiring, open-minded clients who
      understand and value the creative journey and process.
