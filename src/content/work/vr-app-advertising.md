  If you could go anywhere, where would YOU go? Explore new world through an
  epic Virtual Reality library, available on the FREE Franklin Institute mobile
  app. Campaign to drive app downloads for VR library. \

  Visual concept: A photo of someone young and good-looking holding a phone in
  front of themselves and looking at it (shot looking at the back of the phone
  so we don’t see the screen but do see the person’s face). Their expression is
  one of wonder and amazement. Behind and surrounding this guest, we see the
  screenshots from our VR library—from the flight deck of the endeavor space
  shuttle, inside the Chernobyl control room, alongside the curiosity rover.


  As creative director and design on this project, I worked closely with our
  Marketing to conceptualize and strategize, chose models, stills from VR
  libraries, art directed the photoshoots, and designed all digital
  advertisements.
