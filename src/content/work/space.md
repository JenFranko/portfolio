  Exploration and imagination intersect in the Space Command exhibition. The
  phases of the Moon come into focus as you learn about Earth’s only natural
  satellite. Construct a rover and see how it fares on a rocky terrain. Spin a
  ball into the Gravity Well and see centripetal force in action. Touch the
  meteorite—the oldest thing you’ll ever touch. The internal exhibition team was
  tasked with refreshing and updating the look, feel, and content of the exhibit
  while incorporating existing elements. 


  Directed, designed, and produced all graphics for the exhibition. Work within
  multiple constraints, such as reusing existing structural elements in the
  space, incorporated an existing color palette, and keeping as much of the
  production and labor in-house as possible.
