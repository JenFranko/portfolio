  ## Project Overview


  NOW/NEXT is built for speed, features-changing exhibits fueled by pop culture
  and emerging trends in science and technology. Designed with modular
  components are used to maintain a responsive, flexible space that invites
  visitors into the dynamic pace of innovation. The hardware, cabling, and
  infrastructure of the exhibit are exposed, serving as the backdrop for
  objects, large projections, colorful diagrams, graphics, and animations.
  (Funded by The Barra Foundation)


  For this project I art directed and designed Now/Next, working with a team to
  conceptualize the content strategy. From there, I developed the design
  strategy and produced all exhibit graphics, as well as marketing and brand
  materials. In order to make engaging, and easy-to-understand interpretative
  interactives and videos, I worked with local animators
  ([ReMade](http://weareremade.com/)) to build animated features.
